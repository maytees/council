# Resume Writing Tips

Your resume is your first impressionâ€”make it count!

## Creating Your Resume

Start with a clean, simple layout that highlights your key information. Include your name and contact details at the top, followed by sections for education, work experience (if any), skills, and extracurricular activities. For high school students, part-time jobs, volunteer work, or school projects can demonstrate valuable experience. Use bullet points to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments, it is recommended to start each with action verbs.

## Best Practices

Keep your resume to one page, and tailor it for each job by emphasizing skills or experiences relevant to the role. If you're applying for your first job, focus on transferable skills like communication, teamwork, or time management. 

## Final Steps

Proofread carefully to avoid typos, and consider asking a teacher, parent, or friend to review it for feedback. A polished, focused resume can make you stand out and land you the opportunity you're looking for!
