# Interview Tips

Preparing for an interview can make all the difference in landing the job you want.

## Preparation

Start by researching the company or employer—knowing a bit about their work and values shows initiative and interest. Review the job description carefully and think about how your skills and experiences align with the role. Practice common interview questions, such as "Can you tell me about yourself?" or "Why do you want this job?" Be ready to share specific examples of your strengths, like times you've solved a problem, worked in a team, or taken on responsibility.

## Day of the Interview

On the day of the interview, dress appropriately to make a positive impression. For most high school job opportunities, neat, casual, or business-casual attire is a safe choice. Arrive on time—or a few minutes early—and bring a copy of your résumé or any other materials the employer requested. If it's a virtual interview, ensure your technology is working and that you're in a quiet, distraction-free space.

## During the Interview

During the interview, listen carefully to questions and take a moment to think before answering. Be honest about your skills and experiences, even if you're just starting out—employers value enthusiasm, a willingness to learn, and a good attitude as much as experience. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the role, such as "What does a typical day look like?" or "What qualities are you looking for in a candidate?" Asking thoughtful questions shows you're serious about the opportunity.

## Follow Up

After the interview, always follow up with a thank-you note or email to express your gratitude for the opportunity. This small gesture leaves a lasting impression and can set you apart from other candidates.

**Remember:** Whether or not you get the job, view each interview as a learning experience that helps you improve for the future!
