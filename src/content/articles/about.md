# Welcome to Council!

As three high school seniors at South Lakes High School, we realize the challenges faced by many peers around us when seeking part-time job opportunities. The job searching process involving filtering through job postings, applications, and internships is intimidating without having the appropriate resources and direction.

## Our Vision

The vision of Council is to provide students with a platform that recognizes and rewards their hard work and dreams. We believe that each student deserves access to opportunities that will help them develop personally and professionally. Our hope is that, through our website, job searching will be easier for students and an effortless platform for employers to reach future talent.

## Our Platform

Our site is carefully designed to promote success through the features such as job listings, an easy application process, and resources intended to assist students in thriving in their chosen fields. Through linking students and employers, we hope to provide the next generation with confidence, commitment, and a deep sense of purpose.

Collectively, we are committed to building a platform that helps students achieve their dreams and brings career possibilities within reach for everyone. For any questions about the application, do not hesitate to contact us at any time!
