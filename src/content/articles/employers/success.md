# Success Stories

### Sarah M., Junior
> "I was feeling so overwhelmed trying to find a part-time job that would fit around my school schedule, but this website made it so easy! I found a tutoring job within a week, and I'm loving it. It's close to home, pays well, and works perfectly with my busy life. Thank you for creating such an amazing resource!"

### Jason L., Senior
> "As a senior, I really needed an internship to boost my college application, but I had no idea where to start. I used Council and was able to land an internship with a local tech start-up company. The process was simple to navigate, and I even got fantastic advice from the guidance section. This has been a lifesaver for my future!"

### Mia T., Sophomore
> "I was nervous about applying for my first job, but this site made it a breeze! The listings are super easy to browse, and I applied directly through the website. I just got hired as a barista at my favorite caf√©! I feel so much more confident and independent now."
