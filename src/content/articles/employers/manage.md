# Manage Postings

As an employer or counselor, you can manage your job postings directly from this page. Once your job posting has been approved by our team, you'll have the ability to update, edit, or delete it as needed. This ensures your job listing is always accurate and up-to-date.

## Step 1: View Your Active Job Postings

You'll see a list of all the job postings you've submitted and that have been approved by our team. Each listing will include:
- Job Title
- Job Location
- Status (Active/Expired)
- Posting Date

## Step 2: Edit Your Job Posting

If any details of your job posting need updating (such as the description, qualifications, or compensation), click the "Edit" button next to the posting. You can adjust:
- Job title
- Description
- Hours
- Skills required
- And more

Once you've made the changes, click Save to update the listing.

## Step 3: Extend or Remove Job Posting

You can choose to extend the duration of your job posting if the position is still open or remove it if it's been filled or expired.

### Extend
If you wish to extend the posting period, click the "Extend" button and update the new application deadline.

### Remove
Click the "Remove" button to remove the job posting from the site permanently. Please confirm your action before proceeding, as this cannot be undone.

## Step 4: View Applicants

For each job posting, you'll be able to see a list of students who have applied. You can click on any applicant to view their details, including their resume and cover letter, if they've submitted one. This will help you make the best decision for your open position and be able to contact the applicant for the next step.
